<!-- FEDERATED LEARNING TUTORIAL -->
## Know before you go

Hi there and Welcome to this tutorial :smiley:

As you might have seen on the [event agenda](https://www.neurosummerschool.org/) on the 5th of July there will be a "Federated Learning Turorial" where you will have the chance to learn how to set up a complete federated learning (FL) environment and conduct FL experiments for both classification and segmentation workloads

The tutorial will be split in 2 sessions:
1. "From zero to hero": 1h session, optional
2. "Advanced session: mastering OpenFL": 3h session, required

The first session will be focused on how to create the correct python environment to install the [Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) library](https://github.com/intel/openfl), which has facilitated the largest to-date real-world FL study, while the second will include hands-on advanced exercises.
 
Since the assumption for the advanced session is that you will have access to a working environment properly configured, you will have the freedoom to choose whether you would like to install the environment by yourself prior to the event, or during the first hour of the session together with us.

If you would like to play with the instructions on your own machine before getting to the Summer School, please follow [these](https://github.com/walteriviera/FL_aux/blob/main/create_fl_env.txt) instructions. They should be straightforward to follow, but in case you would benefit from having additional resources guiding you through the process, here there is a [video tutorial](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/now/ai-video-series/building-the-federation.html) for you.

If you can successfully run the "test_hello_federation.sh" script without error, you are welcome to join the workshop 1 hour later, ready for the Advanced session.

In case you don't have time to prepare or simply prefer to wait for the Summer School, no problems: we will be happy to go through the process together.

Regardless to what option you choose to follow, please be aware that the preferred OS for having a working environment locally installed on your machines is Linux (>=20.04LTS) with Python 3.6,3.7 or 3.8.

We are looking forward to meeting you there! :sunglasses:
