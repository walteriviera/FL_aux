<!-- FEDERATED LEARNING TUTORIAL -->
## Know before you go

Hi there and Welcome to this tutorial :smiley:
As you might have seen on the [event agenda](https://www.neurosummerschool.org/) on the 5th of July there will be a "Federated Learning Turorial" where you will have the chance to learn about [OpenFL](https://github.com/intel/openfl). 

The tutorial will be split in 2 sessions:
1. "From zero to hero": 1h session, optional
2. "Advanced session: mastering OpenFL": 3h session, required

The first session will be focused on how to create the correct python environment to install the OpenFL tool, while the second will include hands-on advanced exercise. 
Since the assumption for the advanced session is that you will have access to a working environment properly configured, you will have the fredoom to choose whether you would like to 
install the environment by yourself or in the first hour.

If you would like to play with the instructions on your own machine before getting to the Summer School, please follow [these](https://github.com/walteriviera/FL_aux/blob/main/create_fl_env.txt) instructions.
If you can successfully run the "test_hello_federation.sh" script without error, you are welcome to join the workshop 1 hour later, ready for the Advanced session.

In case you don't have time to prepare or simply prefer to wait for the Summer School, no problems: we will be happy to go through the process together.
Regardless to what option you choose to follow, please be aware that the preferred OS for having a working environment locally installed on your machines is Linux (>=20.04LTS) with Python 3.6,3.7 or 3.8.

We are looking forward to meeting you there! :sunglasses:
